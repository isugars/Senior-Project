Since this project interfaces with hardware, I have included the files necessary to test the Apache Kafka message
transport layer for both the Raspberry Pi and the Kafka VM instance on my Google Cloud Platform.

Also included in this directory is a ERD for my PostgreSQL database so far.

The message transport layer has not been integrated with the UI at this time, so the app uses a test log to demonstrate
functionality of the widget.

Note that this project is still under development and files are subject to change.
